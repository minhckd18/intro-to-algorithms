Build a program to perform sorting and searching on a series of real numbers. The program includes the following functions:

1/ Enter a sequence of real numbers consisting of n numbers (n<=20) and save it to the file INPUT.TXT

2/ Read data from the INPUT.TXT file, save it to a 1-dimensional array

3/ Use Bubble Sort algorithm (each step displays up to 1 line) and save it to the file OUTPUT1.TXT.

4/ Use Selection Sort algorithm (each step displays up to 1 line) and save it to the file OUTPUT2.TXT

5/ Use Insertion Sort algorithm (each step is displayed up to 1 line) and save it to the file OUTPUT3.TXT.

6/ Using the Sequential Search method, list the index of the elements that has a value greater than your input value, the result is saved to the next line in the file OUTPUT4.TXT

7/ Using Binary Search, find the index of the first element with value (value is a real number entered from the keyboard) on the sorted array a.
