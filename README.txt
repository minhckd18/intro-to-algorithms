Build a program to perform sorting and searching on a series of real numbers. The program includes the following functions:

1/ Enter a sequence of real numbers consisting of n numbers (n<=20) and save it to the file INPUT.TXT
2/ Read data from the INPUT.TXT file, save it to a 1-dimensional array a and display it on the screen
3/ Display the results of sorting the elements in the array a in sentence 2 in ascending order, according to each step of the Bubble Sort algorithm (each step displays up to 1 line) and save it to the file OUTPUT1.TXT.
4/ Display the results of sorting the elements in the array a in sentence 2 in ascending order, according to each step of the Selection Sort algorithm (each step displays up to 1 line) and save it to the file OUTPUT2.TXT
5/ Display the results of sorting the elements in the array a in sentence 2 in ascending order, according to each step of the Insert Sort algorithm (each step is displayed up to 1 line) and save it to the file OUTPUT3.TXT.
6/ Using the sequential search method, list on the screen the index of the elements (knowing that the first element with index 0) in the unsorted array a in sentence 2 has a value greater than value ( value is a real number entered from the keyboard), the result is saved to the next line in the file OUTPUT4.TXT
7/ Using binary search, find the index of the first element with value (value is a real number entered from the keyboard) on the sorted array a.
